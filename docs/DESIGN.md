# Design

## Philosophy

- **Simplicity first** — Minimal dependencies, clear module boundaries, no unnecessary abstraction.
- **Type safety** — Strict TypeScript with no `any` types. Shared interfaces ensure consistency across modules.
- **Testability** — Hono's `app.request()` enables fast integration tests without network I/O.
- **Documentation as code** — Every module, file, and public API is documented. Docs stay in sync with implementation.

## Principles

1. **One responsibility per file** — Each file has a single, clearly stated purpose in its header comment.
2. **Explicit over implicit** — Deno permissions are declared explicitly in task definitions. Dependencies are pinned in the import map.
3. **Layered architecture** — daemon handles HTTP, shared provides types, CLI consumes the API. No circular dependencies.
4. **Web Standards** — Use native `Request`/`Response`, `fetch`, and other Web APIs rather than Node.js-specific abstractions.
